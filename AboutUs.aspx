    <h2>About Us</h2><br />
    <p>A battery management system is any electronic system that manages a rechargeable battery, such as by protecting the battery from operating outside its safe operating area, monitoring its state, calculating secondary data, reporting that data, controlling its environment, authenticating it and / or balancing it.</p>
    <p>Battery thermal management systems can be either passive or active, and the cooling medium can either be air, liquid, or some form of phase change. Air cooling is advantageous in its simplicity. Such systems can be passive, relying only on the convection of the surrounding air, or active, utilizing fans for airflow.</p>
    <p>The additional components of the cooling mechanism also add weight to the BMS, reducing the efficiency of batteries used for transportation.</p>
    <p>Liquid cooling has a higher natural cooling potential than air cooling as liquid coolants tend to have higher thermal conductivities than air.</p>
    <p>The batteries can either be directly submerged in the coolant or coolant can flow through the BMS without directly contacting the battery. </p>
    <p>Indirect cooling has the potential to create large thermal gradients across the BMS due to the increased length of the cooling channels</p>
